#### Research tools, tips, & techniques
- use quotation marks to return exact matches, e.g., `risk management` will return something different than `"risk management"`

#### Zotero-specific stuff

- Managing PDFs in Zotero better with [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/)

- [Zotero workflow tips](https://lauramay.live/2020/07/zotero-note-taking-workflow/)
- to figure out where Zotero is hard-saving PDFs on your machine: go to `Zotero` > `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Files & Folders` and check the Data Directory Location

- export an entire library or folder with `cmd + a` (to select everything) > right-click > `export items`
- `cmd + a + right arrow` open all parent elements
- `cmd + a + left arrow` close all parent elements
- reveal where content was saved by right-clicking on a parent item and selecting `show file`
- to automatically nest an item that was copied into Zotero without metadata within a parent item, select `create parent item` > `manuel entry`
- [merge duplicate entries in Zotero](https://guides.lib.fsu.edu/zotero/content/organize#:~:text=Merging%20Duplicates,column%20to%20merge%20the%20items.)

#### Ian's handy keystroke cheatsheet

note that `cmd` = the command button to the left of yer spacebar

also note that *most* of these are replicable on a Windows machine by replacing `cmd` with `ctrl`

##### the most essential keystroke on any machine
- `cmd + tab` cycle through all open applications

##### basic text interaction
- `cmd + c` copy text
- `cmd + x` cut text
- `cmd + v` paste text
- `cmd + a` select all
- `cmd + z` undo
- `cmd + shift + z` redo

##### cursor movement
- `cmd + <arrow>` move cursor all the way towards arrow direction
- `cmd + shift + arrow` select all text towards arrow direction
- `option + shift + arrow` select whole word towards arrow direction

##### tab and application control
- `cmd + n` new window
- `cmd + t` new tab
- `cmd + shift + t` reopen last closed tab
- `cmd + w` close a tab
- `cmd + q` quit an application
- `cmd + r` refresh (normally in a web browser)
- `cmd + 1` move to your leftmost table
- `cmd + 9` move to your rightmost tab
- `cmd + <number if 2-8>` immediately move to the tab in `<number if 2-8>` position of all tabs

##### deletion
- `fn + delete` delete to right of cursor
- `option + delete` delete entire word to left of cursor
