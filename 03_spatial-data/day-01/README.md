# Understanding our organizing logics

We'll start off this final section of our working group with a day of discussing and sharing our **organizing logics**.

An organizing logic is a framework that guides your personal data management system and all the stuff that it contains.

We have two activities associated with this:
1. Data management challenges (20 mins)
  - Write down your 3 biggest challenges with data management and share with small group
  - Then, return to bigger group and share
2. What are your organizing logics? (40 mins)
