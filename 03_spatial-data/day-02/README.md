# Three softwares for spatial data management

Today, we'll talk about GitHub, QGIS, and PostGIS. These softwares and services are useful for advanced data management, particularly with spatial data.

# Assignment

Before we meet again on 7/27, complete one of the following:

1. PostGIS: go to the PostGIS documentation page and complete sections 3 ([installation](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/installation.html)) through 10 ([geometry exercises](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geometries_exercises.html))
  - NOTE: if you haven't downloaded QGIS before, you probably want to do so. You can download it easily here.
  - This is a [useful video for installing PostGIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTUM9XfDvqk&t=0s)
  - This is a [useful video for loading spatial data into PostGIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZHtEcbEbI)
  - And this is a [useful video that shows some basic integration between QGIS and PostGIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eddcoyLtqqs)


2. GitHub: watch Dan Shiffman's intro to GitHub videos, [1.1 through 1.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). Create a GitHub account, download the GitHub desktop client, and try to migrate a project on to GitHub by creating a repository.

3. File names: find a project you are done with, or your readings, a course youâ€™re teaching, etc. Determine what you want to keep. Rename files, etc. Other steps. Archive the project.
