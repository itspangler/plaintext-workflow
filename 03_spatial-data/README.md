# Part 3 of the working group...

*in which we talk about (spatial) data management*

During the third and final portion of this working group, we're going to focus on technical aspects of spatial data management. While lots of the stuff we discuss can easily be applied to non-spatial data (e.g., data that doesn't contain spatial information like lat/long), it's especially useful for geographic projects.

The goal of all this is to provide you with some useful tools and technologies for running spatial data workflows and building digital infrastructure for personal data and project management. We will **not** be talking in deep detail about things ike spatial analysis, cartography, map creation, data science, etc.

The third section will be broken up into three primary topics, plus an open lab where you can meet with us to ask questions about the assignment:

1. Introduction to version control and spatial databases for geographers (7/18)
2. Optional open lab (7/20)
3. Updates on project migration (7/25)
4. Reflections, challenges, and looking ahead (7/27)
