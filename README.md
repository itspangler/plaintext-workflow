# Welcome to "Managing Information Workflows for Research, Writing, and Data!"

This working group is designed for geographers who are interested in the philosophy of academic practices. Another way of saying that is, how do we approach the stuff we have to do in academia, and why those approaches fail or succeed for us?

We hope that you come away from this working group with both 1) a concrete set of new skills around research, writing, and spatial data management and 2) a stronger sense of why you work the way you do.

Over the course of the summer, please don't hesitate to contact Ian or Jack with questions about topics!
