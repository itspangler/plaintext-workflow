# Reflecting on writing

During this second portion of the working group, we've done a variety of activities that prompted us to think about how and why we write the way we do.

In this final meeting, we'll wrap up the "writing" section by sharing challenges and observations from the lab.

### Outline for the night

1. As a group, discuss the lab---problems, challenges, successes, etc.---and the extent to which it affected how you will approach writing workflows in the future **(20 mins)**
  - Where did you get hung up? What was the hardest part about it? Why?
  - What was the most rewarding part and why?
  - From a technical perspective, what's the biggest thing you think you'll carry with you from the activity?
  - From a conceptual (e.g., "philosophy" of writing) perspective, what did this exercise make you appreciate/question/reconsider about your current writing style?
2. Specific questions from the lab (**20 mins**)
3. Goal setting (**10 mins**)
  - Grab a sheet of paper, empty Word/Markdown doc, etc., and write down a writing goal
  - It can be as small as "finish book review" or as big as "finish my thesis"
  - Spend a few minutes jotting down some specific ways that you'll meet this goal
4. Quick overview of next time we meet (**10 mins**)
  - Last section is "(spatial) data management"
  - Next week, Jack and I will give an overview of GitHub, QGIS, and PostGIS---what these things are, why you'd want to use them, and how you can download + install them
