# A plain text workflow for academic writing

## Goals

The purpose of this lab is to:

  * provide a better sense of why one would choose to work in plain text;
  * highlight key languages/softwares associated with writing in plain text (Markdown, a text editor);
  * teach you how to:
    - set up a plain text writing environment;
    - execute basic document conversion tasks (pandoc, LaTeX);
    - use Zotero to manage citations in plain text (BibTeX);
  * and, most importantly, offer some tools that will prompt you to think about your writing process

## 1. Getting started

### 2.1. Why write in plain text?

In short, writing in plain text is one you can isolate the *practice of writing* from the *task of formatting*.

The standard text editors that many academics use---Microsoft Word, for example, or Google Docs---

### 2.2.

As academics, we have a complicated relationship to writing. We are constantly doing it. Sometimes we write for six hours and produce a paragraph; sometimes we write for an hour and produce six. We write papers for class, notes for seminars, letters of recommendation, lengthy emails, short emails, emails that never get sent, feedback for our students, grants, proposals, exams, exam answers, research materials, theses, dissertations... the list goes on.

All of this falls more or less into the broad category of "scholarly writing," at least insofar as it's stuff that we have to do for our jobs as scholars. Especially the Big Things---grants, dissertations, and journal manuscripts, for example---require some kind of established workflow.

In this lab, you'll be introduced to one such workflow: **plain text writing**.

"plain text" refers to text with no style, formatting, or
