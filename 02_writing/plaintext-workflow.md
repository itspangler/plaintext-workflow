# A plain text workflow for academic writing

## Goals

The purpose of this lab is to:

  * provide a better sense of why one would choose to do scholarly work in plain text;
  * highlight key languages/softwares associated with writing in plain text;
  * teach you how to:
    - set up a plain text writing environment;
    - execute basic document conversion tasks;
    - use Zotero to manage citations in plain text;

The purpose of this lab is NOT to convince you that plain text writing is the only way to go -- on the contrary! What we hope most is that this lab introduces you to tools that will prompt reflection about your writing process. For example, what considerations should you take when approaching scholarly writing in geography? What habits have you developed that you didn't even realize, and what affordances do you rely on that you didn't know you need?

## 1. Getting started

### 1.1. What is plain text, anyway?

#### Rich Text

You're probably familiar with **[rich text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format)**, a shorthand for file formats (`.rtf`, `.doc`) that natively support features like formatting, inline images, and track changes. Microsoft's Word and Apple's Pages are the most common rich text word processing apps. There's a lot going on under the hood of word processors (code, functions) that makes stuff like font families, alignment, and color just a button click away:

#### Plain text

Rich text can be contrasted with **[plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)**, a shorthand for file formats (`.txt`) that contain no formatting features. This includes files written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), a language that allows you to add formatting elements to plain text files with minor alterations such as enclosing text in asterisks. For example, in Markdown, `this text is normal, and **this text is bold**`.

Normally, you compose plain text in **[text editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor)** such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders). These interfaces are powerful:

### 1.2. Why write in plain text?

The primary benefit of writing in plain text is to **isolate the writing process from the tasks of editing and formatting.**

Rich text editors like MS Word and Google Docs bundle writing (e.g., typing words) and formatting (e.g., choosing fonts, adding italics, and so on) into the same interface. You can hide them, but they're always there.



Practically, this means that when we write in Microsoft Word et al., we're often faced with distractions from writing.


### 1.3.

As academics, we have a complicated relationship to writing. We are constantly doing it. Sometimes we write for six hours and produce a paragraph; sometimes we write for an hour and produce six. We write papers for class, notes for seminars, letters of recommendation, lengthy emails, short emails, emails that never get sent, feedback for our students, grants, proposals, exams, exam answers, research materials, theses, dissertations... the list goes on.

All of this falls more or less into the broad category of "scholarly writing," at least insofar as it's stuff that we have to do for our jobs as scholars. Especially the Big Things---grants, dissertations, and journal manuscripts, for example---require some kind of established workflow.

In this lab, you'll be introduced to one such workflow: **plain text writing**.
