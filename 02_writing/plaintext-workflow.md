# A plaintext workflow for academic writing

## 0. Introduction

This lab will get you started with plaintext writing. By the end of it, you will:

  * have a better sense of why one would choose to work in plaintext
  * understand key languages/softwares associated with writing in plaintext (Markdown, a text editor)
  * be able to execute basic computational tasks

The goal of this lab is not to transition all of your work into plain text. Rather, it's to understand *why* plaintext writing can be useful; under *what* circumstances you might want to use it; and *how* you can do that, if you want.

Also, it's okay to hate this exercise and this workflow for writing. Even if that's the case, we hope that you still learn something about what works for you and what doesn't! **This isn't meant to be prescriptive. It's meant to defamiliarize the taken-for-granted practices that comprise our academic work.**

Good luck!
