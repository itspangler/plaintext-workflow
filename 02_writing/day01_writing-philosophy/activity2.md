### Writers on Writing

>"This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do—not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit."

>"I pondered why it was that Mrs Seton had no money to leave us; and what effect poverty has on the mind; and what effect wealth has on the mind; and I thought of the queer old gentlemen I had seen that morning with tufts of fur upon their shoulders; and I remembered how if one whistled one of them ran; and I thought of the organ booming in the chapel and, of the shut doors of the library; and I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I thought how it is worse perhaps to be locked in; and, thinking of the safety and prosperity of the one sex and the poverty and insecurity of the other and of the effect of tradition and of the lack of tradition upon the mind of a writer, I thought at last that it was time to roll up the crumpled skin of the day, with its arguments and its impressions and its anger and its laughter, and cast it into the hedge."

>"Virginia Woolf, in her book A Room of One’s Own, wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with key and lock) and enough money to support herself.
>"What then are we to make of Phillis Wheatley, a slave, who owned not even herself? This sickly, frail black girl who required a servant of her own at times—her health was so precarious—and who, had she been white, would have been easily considered the intellectual superior of all the women and most of the men in the society of her day. ... To be an artist and a black woman, even today, lowers our status in many respects, rather than raises it: and yet, artists we will be.”

<!-- In his memoir on writing, Stephen King argues that writers are *formed* rather than *made*---that one becomes a "writer" primarily through an accumulation of their memories, experiences, and knowledge. That's why, presumably, so many books about writing are filled with bullshit.

King is talking about fiction writing, of course, which is a great deal different from scholarly prose. In academia, it is normal to standardize our prose, speak in a "professional" voice, and forego some conventions (e.g., style/voice) in favor of others (e.g., formulaic). If fiction is about creating wrinkles and folds in one's writing, producing scholarship involves ironing them out.

That's not a knock on scholarly writing, and it certainly doesn't describe all scholarly writing. In making this generalization I'm cognizant that there's a great deal of (non)fiction out there disregarding  More importantly, I think that King's point about writers as *formed* rather than *made* still applies to scholarship. Even academic writing has got a whole lot to do with our positionality: memories, experiences, affordances, and identities. -->
