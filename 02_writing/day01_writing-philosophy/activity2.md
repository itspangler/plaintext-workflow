# Activity 2 (30 minutes)

In the first activity, we confronted feelings and emotions that we have when we think about writing. However, we didn't actually confront the process or practice of writing itself. This activity serves as a prompt to think about the tools and technologies that writing requires of us.

### Read these quotes

>"I pondered... what effect poverty has on the mind; and what effect wealth has on the mind; and I thought of the queer old gentlemen I had seen that morning with tufts of fur upon their shoulders; and I remembered how if one whistled one of them ran; and I thought of the organ booming in the chapel and, of the shut doors of the library; and I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I thought how it is worse perhaps to be locked in; and, thinking of the safety and prosperity of the one sex and the poverty and insecurity of the other and of the effect of tradition and of the lack of tradition upon the mind of a writer, I thought at last that it was time to roll up the crumpled skin of the day, with its arguments and its impressions and its anger and its laughter, and cast it into the hedge."

>"Virginia Woolf, in her book A Room of One’s Own, wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with key and lock) and enough money to support herself.

>"What then are we to make of Phillis Wheatley, a slave, who owned not even herself? This sickly, frail black girl who required a servant of her own at times—her health was so precarious—and who, had she been white, would have been easily considered the intellectual superior of all the women and most of the men in the society of her day. ... To be an artist and a black woman, even today, lowers our status in many respects, rather than raises it: and yet, artists we will be.”

>"This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do—not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit."

>"Before we met, I had spent a lifetime devoted to Wittgenstein's idea that the inexpressible is contained—inexpressibly!—in the expressed. This idea gets less air time than his more reverential *Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent*, but it is, I think, the deeper idea. Its paradox is, quite literally, *why I write*, or how I feel able to keep writing.
>
>"For it doesn't feed or exalt any angst one may feel about the incapacity to express, in words, that which eludes them. It doesn't punish what can be said for what, by definition, it cannot be. Nor does it ham it up by miming a constricted throat: *Lo, what I would say, were words good enough.* Words are good enough."

### Spend 15 minutes responding to these questions

1. what is writing?
2. what is required (for you) to write?
3. what interferes with (your) writing process?

Reply to these however you like: in general, individually, in conversation with the above quotes if you wish, etc.

### Once we're done...

Separate into smaller groups again for ~10 minutes to discuss the following as a group. **Elect one person to share answers with full working group when we return.**

1. what did your 10-minute reflection reveal to you? did you realize or notice anything that you don't typically think about when writing?
2. where do your writing preferences tend to harmonize (e.g., stuff most folks agree on/use)? are there patterns in preference across multiple people? why do you think that is?
3. where do your writing preferences tend to diverge? among folks whose styles differ, why do you
4. if you wrote down that you were ambivalent about the writing process entirely, share why.

### After that...

We'll return to the Big Group and spokespeople will share key points/observations from the activity for ~10 minutes.
