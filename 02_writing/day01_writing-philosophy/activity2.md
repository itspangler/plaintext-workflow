### Writers on Writing

>"This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do—not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit."

>"Virginia Woolf, in her book A Room of One’s Own, wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with key and lock) and enough money to support herself.
>"What then are we to make of Phillis Wheatley, a slave, who owned not even herself? This sickly, frail black girl who required a servant of her own at times—her health was so precarious—and who, had she been white, would have been easily considered the intellectual superior of all the women and most of the men in the society of her day. ... To be an artist and a black woman, even today, lowers our status in many respects, rather than raises it: and yet, artists we will be.”

<!-- In his memoir on writing, Stephen King argues that writers are *formed* rather than *made*---that one becomes a "writer" primarily through an accumulation of their memories, experiences, and knowledge. That's why, presumably, so many books about writing are filled with bullshit.

King is talking about fiction writing, of course, which is a great deal different from scholarly prose. In academia, it is normal to standardize our prose, speak in a "professional" voice, and forego some conventions (e.g., style/voice) in favor of others (e.g., formulaic). If fiction is about creating wrinkles and folds in one's writing, producing scholarship involves ironing them out.

That's not a knock on scholarly writing, and it certainly doesn't describe all scholarly writing. In making this generalization I'm cognizant that there's a great deal of (non)fiction out there disregarding  More importantly, I think that King's point about writers as *formed* rather than *made* still applies to scholarship. Even academic writing has got a whole lot to do with our positionality: memories, experiences, affordances, and identities. -->
