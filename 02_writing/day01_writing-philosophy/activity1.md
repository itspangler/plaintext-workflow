# Activity 1 (30 minutes)

### Spend 10 minutes answering these questions.

1. what is writing?
2. when you write, are there "non-writing" tasks that you feel you either REQUIRE in order to write successfully, or which you feel INTERFERE with your writing? (e.g., editing, formatting, researching)
3. enumerate your technical stack for writing. I'm talking about "technical" in the sense of ANY TECHNOLOGY: paper, pencil vs. pen, computer, laptop, keyboard, writing application, wifi, chair, desk, sunlight, time of day, sun/shade, same place always vs. change it up, etc. all of these things, whether material or ephemeral, are technologies that assist us in the writing process

### Once you're done...

We'll separate into breakout groups for ~10 minutes to share our technical stack with others and answer the following questions. **Elect one person to share answers with full working group when we return.**

1. what did your 5-minute reflection reveal to you? did you realize or notice anything that you don't typically think about when writing?
2. where do your writing preferences tend to harmonize (e..g, stuff most folks agree on/use)? are there patterns in preference across multiple people? why do you think that is?
3. where do your writing preferences tend to diverge? among folks whose styles differ, why do you
4. if you wrote down that you were ambivalent about the writing process/technical stack entirely, share why.

### After that...

We'll return to the Big Group and spokespeople will share key points/observations from the activity.
