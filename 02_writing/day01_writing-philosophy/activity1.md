# Activity 1 (30 minutes)

### Step one

Read this excerpt from Wendy Belcher's (2019) book about writing.

>**UNDERSTANDING FEELINGS ABOUT WRITING**
>
>Writing is to academia what sex was to nineteenth-century Vienna: everybody does it and nobody talks about it.
>
>A leading scholar of productivity found that most academics were more willing to talk about their most personal problems, including sexual dysfunction, than about problems with writing (Boice 1990, 1). The prevalent belief among academics seems to be that writing, like sex, should come naturally, and should be performed in polite privacy.
>
>Because of this silence, writing dysfunction is commonplace in academia. A survey of over sixteen thousand full-time faculty in the United States revealed that almost a fifth did not read or write scholarship in the past two years (Eagan et al. 2014, 9, 29–30, 33). In addition, almost a third had not published any piece of writing in that time. Over half of them spent less than an hour a day reading and writing scholarship. Furthermore, these statistics are self-reported and so reflect the activities of only those organized enough to respond to the survey. A large-scale study without this bias, of actual publication rates for all faculty members in a province, found that many did not publish: two-thirds of the humanities faculty and one third of the social science faculty had not published even one article in the past eight years (Larivière et al. 2010, 48). In other words, unproductive academics are common. Since publication is the major marker of productivity in academia,
these statistics about low productivity are surprising. Or are they?
>
>You don’t have to be Freud to figure out that academia’s silence about writing may be repressive. Writing is, after all, a creative process; and like any such process, it depends on human connection. If you try to create in an environment where sharing is discouraged, dysfunction is the inevitable result. Certainly, many have found that talking about their struggles with writing has been freeing. The lesson: learning to talk about writing is an important key to becoming a productive writer. One of the reasons that academics don’t talk about writing is that it involves talking about feelings. Academics tend to be more comfortable with the rational than the emotional. Therefore, even if we do manage to talk about writing, we’re more likely to talk about content than process. So the first step to success is for you to acknowledge your feelings about writing. Mindfulness is essential. Let’s start with a broad question.
>
>What feelings come up when you contemplate writing?

Then, answer the following, in order. (These responses could be prose or they could simply be bulleted lists, etc.)

1. What are your feelings about your experience of writing?
2. What are the common elements in your negative feelings about writing?
3. Consider any good memories and positive feelings you have of writing: What made that experience/those experiences good? What were the common denominators?

### Step two

We'll separate into smaller groups for about 10 minutes and share responses.

Go number by number and compare notes. What are your common feelings? What common elements comprise your group's negative feelings?

Elect a representative to report back to the Big Group with observations on what people shared and what differed.

### Step three

Return to the Big Group and for about 10 minutes reps will share key points.
