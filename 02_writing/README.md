# Part 2 of the working group...

*... in which we talk about writing and test out new ways to write and figure out if they worked or not and why*

This section of the working group is broken up into 3 parts:

1. [Philosophy of writing](activity1.md)
2. [A practical approach to plain text writing](/activity2.md)
3. Reflecting on plain text, philosophy, practice, etc.
