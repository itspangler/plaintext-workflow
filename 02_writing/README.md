# Philosophy of Writing

## 1. On writing

>"This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do—not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit."

In his memoir on writing, Stephen King argues that writers are *formed* rather than *made*---that one becomes a "writer" primarily through an accumulation of their memories, experiences, and knowledge. That's why, presumably, so many books about writing are filled with bullshit.

King is talking about fiction writing, of course, which is a great deal different from scholarly prose. In academia, it is normal to standardize our prose, speak in a "professional" voice, and forego some conventions (e.g., style/voice) in favor of others (e.g., formulaic). If fiction is about creating wrinkles and folds in one's writing, producing scholarship involves ironing them out.

That's not a knock on scholarly writing, and it certainly doesn't describe all scholarly writing. In making this generalization I'm cognizant that there's a great deal of (non)fiction out there disregarding  More importantly, I think that King's point about writers as *formed* rather than *made* still applies to scholarship. Even academic writing has got a whole lot to do with our positionality: memories, experiences, affordances, and identities.
